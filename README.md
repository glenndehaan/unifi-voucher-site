## Prerequisites

- UniFi Network Controller (Cloud Key, Dream Machine, or Controller software)
- UniFi Access Point (AP)
- UniFi Local Account with 'Full Management' access

[Follow this guide to set up the Hotspot Portal](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000166827-UniFi-Hotspot-Portal-and-Guest-WiFi), then continue with the installation below

> Ensure voucher authentication is enabled within the Hotspot Portal

> Attention!: We recommend only using Local UniFi accounts due to short token lengths provided by UniFi Cloud Accounts. Also, UniFi Cloud Accounts using 2FA are not supported!

> Note: When creating a Local UniFi account ensure you give 'Full Management' access rights to the Network controller. The 'Hotspot Role' won't give access to the API and therefore the application will throw errors.

## Installation

### Docker

You can easily run UniFi Voucher Site using Docker. We provide two release tracks to ensure you have flexibility in how you manage your deployments:

- **Master Branch**: The `latest` Docker tag is always built from the `master` branch. This tag contains the most recent changes, but may also include experimental or less stable features.
- **Tag-based Versions**: For production environments, we recommend using tag-based versions. These tags correspond to specific, stable releases of the application. To use a tag-based version, simply replace `latest` with the desired version number.

**Below is an example docker-compose.yml file that can help you get started:**

```yaml

**Configuration Options**

By default, UniFi Voucher Site is configured using environment variables. However, you can optionally provide a configuration file named `options.json` instead. When using a config file, it will override environment variable settings.

To use a config file, mount it into the container at:

```
/data/options.json
```

The structure of the file should use lowercase versions of the environment variable names.

**Example `options.json`:**

```json
{
  "unifi_ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "unifi_port": 443,
  "unifi_username": "admin",
  "unifi_password": "password",
  "unifi_site_id": "default",
  "unifi_ssid": "",
  "unifi_ssid_password": "",

## Authentication

The UniFi Voucher Site provides three options for authenticating access to the web service.

> Note that these options only affect the web service; the API service uses a different authentication method, which is explained above.

### 1. Internal Authentication (Default)

By default, the UniFi Voucher Site uses an internal authentication method. You can set the password for this internal authentication using the `AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD` environment variable.

```env
AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD: '0000'
```

> To enable/disable internal authentication use the `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` environment variable

### 2. OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication

The UniFi Voucher Site allows seamless integration with OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling users to authenticate through their preferred identity provider (IdP). Configuration is easy using environment variables to align with your existing OIDC provider.

#### Required Configuration

To enable OIDC authentication, set the following environment variables in your application’s environment:

- **`AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED`**:
  Toggle to enable/disable OIDC authentication. Set this value to `true` to enable OIDC authentication. (Default: `false`)

- **`AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER_BASE_URL`**:
  The base URL of your OIDC provider. This is typically the URL where the well-known OIDC configuration is hosted (e.g., `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`).

- **`AUTH_OIDC_APP_BASE_URL`**:
  The base URL of your UniFi Voucher Site application. This should be the public URL where the site is accessible to users (e.g., `https://voucher.example.com`).

- **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`**:
  The client ID registered with your OIDC provider. This value is specific to the OIDC client created for the UniFi Voucher Site.

- **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`**:
  The client secret associated with your OIDC provider. This value is specific to the OIDC client created for the UniFi Voucher Site.

> Ensure your idP supports **Confidential Clients** with the **Authorization Code Flow**

#### Optional Configuration

* **`AUTH_OIDC_RESTRICT_VISIBILITY`**:
  Restricts user access to only vouchers created within their own organization.
  When enabled (`true`), users can only manage vouchers tied to their organization's domain, determined by the domain of their email address (including subdomains and top-level domains).
  This is useful in environments where multiple organizations share a single UniFi Controller instance.
  **Default:** `false`

#### Determine Supported Client Types

To identify which client types your OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider supports, you can check the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint. This endpoint contains metadata about the OIDC provider, including the supported flows and grant types.

1. **Access the `.well-known/openid-configuration` URL:**

   The URL is typically structured like this:
   ```text
   https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
   ```

2. **Look for the `grant_types_supported` Field:**

   In the returned JSON, the `grant_types_supported` field will indicate the flows your provider supports: Check if your response contains `authorization_code`.

   Example snippet:
   ```json
   {
     "grant_types_supported": [
       "authorization_code",
       "implicit",
       "refresh_token",
       "client_credentials"
     ]
   }
   ```

#### OIDC IdP Integration Guides

This section provides integration guides for configuring the UniFi Voucher Site with various OIDC (OpenID Connect) Identity Providers (IdPs). These guides cover the necessary steps for setting up the IdP, configuring client credentials, and integrating the IdP with the UniFi Voucher Site.

Below is a list of tested Identity Providers (IdPs) with detailed integration instructions:

- [Keycloak](.docs/oidc/keycloak/README.md)
- [Authentik](.docs/oidc/authentik/README.md)
- [UniFi Identity Enterprise (UID)](.docs/oidc/uid/README.md)
- [ZITADEL](.docs/oidc/zitadel/README.md)

> Integrated with an IdP that is not on the list? Feel free to create a guide for others and contribute it to the project

### 3. Disabling Authentication

If you prefer not to use any authentication for the web and api service, you can disable it entirely by setting the `AUTH_DISABLE` environment variable.

```env
AUTH_DISABLE: 'true'
```

> Note: This disables the token based authentication on the API

---

## Print Functionality

The UniFi Voucher Site application includes built-in support for printing vouchers using 80mm receipt printers, offering a convenient way to distribute vouchers in physical format.

### Compatibility

The print functionality is compatible with most 80mm thermal receipt printers commonly used in various industries. These printers typically use thermal printing technology, eliminating the need for ink cartridges and ensuring efficient and cost-effective voucher printing.

### Configuration

To enable the print feature, you need to set the following environment variables:

```env
PRINTERS: ''
```

Here’s what each variable represents:

- **`PRINTERS`**: Sets the printer type used by UniFi Voucher Site. Supported options:
    - `pdf`: For generating PDF files formatted for 80mm paper width.
    - `escpos`: For printing directly to network-enabled ESC/POS compatible printers. Specify the IP address of the network-enabled ESC/POS printer

> You can have multiple printers available at the same time.
> Let's say you have 2 ESC/POS network printers and want to print via pdf, then define:
> ```env
> PRINTERS: 'pdf,192.168.1.10,192.168.1.11'
> ```

### Usage

#### PDF

If you're using the PDF option, once your 80mm receipt printer is configured and connected to your local client, you can easily export vouchers to pdf from the UniFi Voucher Site application. Simply navigate to the voucher within the interface and click on the "Print" button.

The application will automatically format the voucher for 80mm paper width, ensuring optimal printing results. Depending on your printer settings and preferences, you may adjust print quality, paper type, and other printing parameters to suit your needs.

##### Example PDF

![Example PDF](.docs/images/pdf_example.png)

#### ESC/POS

For network-enabled ESC/POS compatible printers, provide the printer's IP address in the `PRINTERS` variable. Once configured, you can print vouchers directly to your network printer from the UniFi Voucher Site application.

Just like with PDF printing, navigate to the voucher and click on the "Print" button. The application will send the print job directly to the ESC/POS printer over the network, ensuring quick and seamless voucher printing. Make sure your printer supports ESC/POS commands and is correctly configured to accept print jobs over the network.

##### Tested Printers

- EPSON TM-T88V
- EPSON TM-T20X
- EPSON TM-T82IIIL
- Posman BTP-R880NP
- NetumScan NT-8360 / 80-V

##### Example Print

## Email Functionality

The UniFi Voucher Site includes a convenient email feature that allows you to send vouchers directly to users from the web interface. By configuring the SMTP settings, you can enable email sending and make it easy to distribute vouchers digitally.

### Configuration

To enable the email feature, you need to set the following environment variables with your SMTP server details:

```env
SMTP_FROM: ''
SMTP_HOST: ''
SMTP_PORT: ''
SMTP_SECURE: ''
SMTP_USERNAME: ''
SMTP_PASSWORD: ''
```

Here’s what each variable represents:

- **`SMTP_FROM`**: The sender email address that will appear in the "From" field when users receive the voucher.
- **`SMTP_HOST`**: The hostname or IP address of your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.example.com`).
- **`SMTP_PORT`**: The port used by your SMTP server (e.g., `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL).
- **`SMTP_SECURE`**: Set to `true` if your SMTP server requires a secure connection (SSL/TLS), or `false` if it does not.
- **`SMTP_USERNAME`**: The username for authenticating with your SMTP server.
- **`SMTP_PASSWORD`**: The password for authenticating with your SMTP server.

These settings allow the application to connect to your SMTP server and send emails on your behalf.

### Usage

Once the SMTP environment variables are configured, the email feature will be available within the UniFi Voucher Site interface. After generating a voucher, you will see an option to send the voucher via email. Enter the recipient's email address, and the application will send the voucher details directly to their inbox.

## Kiosk Functionality

The UniFi Voucher Site includes a **Kiosk Mode**, allowing users to generate their own vouchers via a self-service interface. This is ideal for public areas, such as cafés, hotels, and co-working spaces, where users can obtain internet access without staff intervention.

To enable the kiosk functionality, set the following environment variables:

```env
KIOSK_ENABLED: 'true'
KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES: '480,1,,,;'
```

### Configuration

- **`KIOSK_ENABLED`**:
    - Set to `'true'` to enable the kiosk page, making it accessible at `/kiosk`.
    - Set to `'false'` to disable the kiosk functionality.

- **`KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES`**: Defines the voucher properties for kiosk-generated vouchers. The format consists of the following parameters:

  ```text
  expiration_in_minutes,single_use_or_multi_use,upload_speed_limit_kbps,download_speed_limit_kbps,data_transfer_limit_MB
  ```

    - **Expiration (required)**: The validity period of the voucher in minutes. Example: `480` (8 hours).
    - **Voucher Type (required)**: Defines if the voucher is single-use or multi-use:
        - `'0'` → Multi-use (unlimited)
        - `'1'` → Single-use
        - `'N'` → Multi-use (N times) (e.g., `'3'` allows 3 uses)
    - **Upload Speed Limit (optional)**: Maximum upload speed in Kbps. Leave empty to disable.
    - **Download Speed Limit (optional)**: Maximum download speed in Kbps. Leave empty to disable.
    - **Data Transfer Limit (optional)**: Total data limit in MB. Leave empty to disable.

  > **Multiple Voucher Types:**
  > You can define multiple voucher types by separating each configuration with a semicolon (`;`).
  > Example:
  >
  > ```text
  > 480,1,,,;1440,0,512,2048,1000
  > ```
  >
  > This defines two voucher types:
  >
  > 1. A single-use voucher valid for 480 minutes with no speed or data limits.
  > 2. A multi-use (unlimited) voucher valid for 1440 minutes, limited to 512 Kbps upload, 2048 Kbps download, and 1000 MB data.

- **`KIOSK_NAME_REQUIRED`**:
    - Set to `'true'` to enable the requirement for a guest to enter their name before generating a voucher.
    - Set to `'false'` to disable to allow generation of vouchers without a name.

* **`KIOSK_PRINTER`**:

    * Set this to the IP address of an ESC/POS-compatible network printer to enable automatic voucher printing.
    * Leave this value empty to disable printing.
    * Example:

      ```text
      KIOSK_PRINTER=192.168.1.50
      ```

### Custom Branding (Logo and Background)

You can customize the appearance of the kiosk page by providing your own `logo.png` and `bg.jpg` images.

To do this, use Docker volume mappings to mount your custom assets to the `/kiosk` directory inside the container. The application will use these files (if present) instead of the default ones.

#### Example

Suppose you have your custom images in a local directory called `branding/`:

```
branding/
├── logo.png
└── bg.jpg
```

You can configure this using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  unifi-voucher-site:
    image: glenndehaan/unifi-voucher-site:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      KIOSK_ENABLED: 'true'
      KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES: '480,1,,,;'
    volumes:
      - ./branding:/kiosk
```

> **Note:** Ensure `logo.png` and `bg.jpg` are valid image files. Both are optional — only override the ones you want to customize.

### Usage

Once enabled, the kiosk page is available at:

```
http://localhost:3000/kiosk
```

Users can visit this URL and generate a voucher without administrative intervention.

## Migration Guide

### Migration from 6.x to 7.x

When upgrading from 6.x to 7.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **`KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPE` Renamed to `KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES`**

    * The configuration variable **`KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPE`** has been **renamed** to **`KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES`** in 7.x.
    * This change supports multiple voucher types and enhances configurability.

   **Before (6.x):**

   ```env
   KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPE='480,1,,,'
   ```

   **After (7.x):**

   ```env
   KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES='480,1,,,;'
   ```

    * Update your environment configuration to use the new `KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPES` variable.
    * Ensure the values provided are valid and supported — refer to the [Kiosk Configuration](#configuration-2) for the complete list of accepted types and formatting rules.

> Make sure to remove the deprecated `KIOSK_VOUCHER_TYPE` and follow the structure outlined in the documentation to avoid misconfiguration issues during deployment.

### Migration from 5.x to 6.x

When upgrading from 5.x to 6.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **`UI_BACK_BUTTON` Removed**

    - The `UI_BACK_BUTTON` configuration option has been **removed** in 6.x.
    - This setting is no longer used and can be safely **removed from your environment configuration**.

2. **Printer Configuration Changes**

    - The legacy printer configuration options **`PRINTER_TYPE`** and **`PRINTER_IP`** have been replaced by a single setting: **`PRINTERS`**.
    - The new format is a **comma-separated string** combining the printer type and IP address.

    **Before (5.x):**

    ```env
    PRINTER_TYPE='pdf'
    PRINTER_IP='192.168.1.10'
    ```

    **After (6.x):**

    PRINTERS='pdf,192.168.1.10'
    ```

    - Update your configuration to use `PRINTERS` and remove the old `PRINTER_TYPE` and `PRINTER_IP` variables.

> Make sure to clean up any deprecated variables and update your printer configuration to ensure compatibility with 6.x.

### Migration from 4.x to 5.x

When upgrading from 4.x to 5.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **Updated `/api` Endpoint Response**
    - The `/api` endpoint now returns a structured response that includes the HTTP method for each available endpoint. Update API integrations to handle the new response structure.

    **Previous Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "error": null,
      "data": {
        "message": "OK",
        "endpoints": [
          "/api",
          "/api/types",
          "/api/voucher/:type",
          "/api/vouchers"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    **New Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "error": null,
      "data": {
        "message": "OK",
        "endpoints": [
          { "method": "GET", "endpoint": "/api" },
          { "method": "GET", "endpoint": "/api/types" },
          { "method": "GET", "endpoint": "/api/languages" },
          { "method": "GET", "endpoint": "/api/vouchers" },
          { "method": "POST", "endpoint": "/api/voucher" }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

2. **`/api/voucher/:type` Endpoint Replacement**
    - The **`/api/voucher/:type`** endpoint has been replaced by **`/api/voucher`**.
    - The method has changed from **`GET`** to **`POST`**.
    - The `:type` URL parameter is now passed in the **JSON body**.

    **Example Request:**

    ```http
    POST /api/voucher
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "type": "480,0,,,"
    }
    ```

### Migration from 3.x to 4.x

When upgrading from 3.x to 4.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **OIDC Public Flow Removal**
    - The OIDC public flow has been removed in v4. Only the **confidential flow** is now supported.
    - Users must migrate to the confidential flow. Updated integration guides are available to help with this migration: [OIDC IdP Integration Guides](#oidc-idp-integration-guides).

2. **OIDC Endpoints Update**
    - OIDC endpoints have been moved to dedicated paths.
    - Update the IdP callback URL from **`/callback`** to **`/oidc/callback`** in your IdP configuration.

3. **Environment Variable Changes**
    - **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_TYPE`** has been **removed**. It is no longer required.
    - **`AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED`** has been introduced. If you are using OIDC, you must set `AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED` to **`true`** in your environment configuration.
    - **`AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED`** has been introduced.
        - If you are using **internal authentication**, set `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` to **`true`**.
        - If you are using OIDC **and want to disable internal authentication**, set `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` to **`false`**.

4. **Password Variable Rename**
    - **`AUTH_PASSWORD`** has been renamed to **`AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD`**.
    - Update your environment variable to use `AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD` if you rely on internal authentication.

5. **Bearer Token Variable Rename**
    - **`AUTH_TOKEN`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_INTERNAL_BEARER_TOKEN`**.
    - Update your environment variable to use `AUTH_INTERNAL_BEARER_TOKEN` for api bearer token authentication.

### Migration from 2.x to 3.x

When upgrading from 2.x to 3.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **`SECURITY_CODE`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_PASSWORD`**.
    - Update your environment variables configuration to use `AUTH_PASSWORD` instead of `SECURITY_CODE`.

2. **`DISABLE_AUTH`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_DISABLE`**.
    - Replace `DISABLE_AUTH` with `AUTH_DISABLE` in your environment variables.

3. The API bearer token now uses a dedicated variable **`AUTH_TOKEN`**.
    - Ensure that your API token is now stored under the `AUTH_TOKEN` variable and update your implementations to use this new token instead of the `SECURITY_CODE`.

### Migration from 1.x to 2.x

No migration steps are required.

### Migration from Versions Prior to v1

Versions before v1 do not have a direct migration path. If you are using a version earlier than v1, a fresh installation is required. Be sure to back up any important data before proceeding with a re-install.
